Colormake
---------

This is a simple wrapper for making the output from make easier to read
(more colorful), and errors easier to find in messy compilations.  It was
inspired by Micheal T. Babcock's excellent logcolorize program.


Files
-----

colormake.pl   A perl filter, which colorizes make's output.
cmake          A shell script, which combines make and colormake.pl
clmake         A shell script, which combines make, colormake.pl and less

The rest is documentation.


Installation
------------

cp colormake.pl cmake clmake /usr/local/bin/


Usage
-----

Type "cmake" or "clmake" whenever you'd ordinarily type "make".
